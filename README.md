# arm-assessment1

We are looking for not only the actual solution but also the road to the solution, please include that as well in GIT. The focus will be on why you have chosen a certain way to approach this assignment. We could understand that you might need to make some assumptions during this assessment, please write down the assumptions you make as well. Please include a simple time log as well of the activities performed by you, so we have some indication of your speed ;-) TIP: If your time log is really fast, we will expect this from you constantly :-) Do not be afraid to use your own creativity and show us more than we have requested if you think some things could be handy as well

Key aspect we would like to see are:

Reusability

Flexibility

Robustness

If the assessment is approved for the next step, we expect a presentation of your assessment by you. You are free to choose the format for this presentation.


The assignment:


Using ARM templates and best practices, create the following:


An Azure Datalake Gen 2 storage account.

A key vault with a secret

A virtual network

A web app that can access both the datalake storage and the key vault secret

A load balancer that sits between the web app and the internet

Use tags to group the resources. 


Take note of your assumptions, and explain the choices you made


Deliverable:

Provide us with a public GitHub repository containing the assignment.
